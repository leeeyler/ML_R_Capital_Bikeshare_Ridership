# bikeshare_ridership_prediction_project

This is the final project for the Intro to Data Science course at George Washington University.

The goal of the project is to develop a model that predicts Capital City Bikeshare ridership.

My group and I implemented and evaluated three predictions models:  Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forrest Regression.

The project covers:

    1)  identifying a challenge
    2)  gathering, wrangling, cleaing data
    3)  exploratory data analysis
    4)  feature engineering
    5)  model creation and evaluation
    6)  recommendation
